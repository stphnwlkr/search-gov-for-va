# search-gov-for-va
Search.gov plugin for WP VIP
## Purpose
This plugin allows WordPress to use the Search.gov API (https://search.gov). In the admin you set you affiliate id and you API key. This uses facets and highlighting by default. It is also developed using the custom meta properties (searchgov_custom1,searchgov_custom2,searchgov_custom3), for a very specific use case and may not meet your needs. 
## Future Development
This is very much a work in progress and this should be considered an MVP and not a one and done release. While this is title "for WP VIP," there is nothing in the code at this point that is unique to the VIP platform.
